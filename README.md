**Conway's Game of Life**

Conway's Game of Life, devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970, is a captivating simulation played on a grid of cells. It's a zero-player game where the evolution of each cell is determined by four simple rules:

- *Birth*: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- *Survival*: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
- *Death*: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies of loneliness.
- *Death*: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies of overcrowding.

These rules govern the dynamics of the game, dictating the life, death, and reproduction of cells based on their immediate neighborhood. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life showcases mesmerizing emergent patterns and behaviors.
